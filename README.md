# frc2018Kotlin

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/team5499/frc2018Kotlin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/team5499/frc2018Kotlin) [![Code Coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/team5499/frc2018Kotlin/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/team5499/frc2018Kotlin)

## Getting started
### Pre-commit
First, install the project's [pre-commit](http://pre-commit.com/) hooks (**do this immediately after cloning!**)
```
./gradlew install_hooks
```
Pre-commit hooks are programs that check the files you've changed each time you make a new commit. They will prevent you from checking in things like invalid JSON, code that fails the [Kotlin linter](https://github.com/shyiko/ktlint/), and more.

### Testing
To test your code, run:
```
./gradlew test
```
Test frequently and always test before deploying code to a roboRIO. Running tests will also run pre-commit on all of the files in the repo.

### Deploying
To deploy your code, run:
```
./gradlew deploy
```

## Troubleshooting

### False positives from the detekt-wrapper hook
[detekt](https://github.com/arturbosch/detekt/) helps catch common [code smells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell) in your program. If you encounter a false positive, you have two options:
* [Suppress the issue using the @Suppress annotation](https://arturbosch.github.io/detekt/suppressing-rules.html)
* Disable the issue across the whole project. To do this, you'll need to tell detekt to use a configuration file. Apply the following change to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:
  ```diff
  --- a/.pre-commit-config.yaml
  +++ b/.pre-commit-config.yaml
  @@ -13,7 +14,9 @@ repos:
           args: [--autofix]
       - id: trailing-whitespace
   -   repo: https://github.com/team5499/pre-commit-hooks
       rev: v0.3.1
       hooks:
       -   id: ktlint-wrapper
       -   id: detekt-wrapper
  +        args: [--config .detekt-config.yml]
  ```
  Then save the [default detekt configuration](https://github.com/arturbosch/detekt/blob/master/detekt-cli/src/main/resources/default-detekt-config.yml) as `.detekt-config.yml` and edit it as desired.
